A globally recognized teacher, speaker, healer, and writer on the intersection of personal and collective awakening, her passion for the realization of our potential matches her concern for humanity's impending crises—her fervent wish that we "wake up in time."

						Anodea, you have had a huge influence on me personally as a student and the impact it has had on me as a teacher. Your work was instrumental in helping me connect the mind-body in a theoretical way and then apply it to a yoga practice that I had been deeply committed to for years. It dropped in such an embodied way that suddenly for the first time it made sense, and I could do deeper transformational work and get clues and insights into my own psychology just by doing the same asana practice that I do every single day, but tuning in to my body in a different way and using the language of the chakras via your lens, it was very impactful to me. When I first discovered Wheels of Life and Eastern Body Western Mind, it provided me a very safe place and a specific tool to be able to gain the necessary insights to do some very serious healing work [which] allowed me the self confidence and allowed me to trust my intuition that created space for a lot of the service work I do in the world today. I couldn't have done it without the self-confidence and the tools from Eastern Body Western Mind allowed me to tap in! I want to thank you publicly for being such an influence and a brilliant mentor in my own person life.
