> *"Anodea, you have had a huge influence on me personally as a student and the impact it has had on me as a teacher. Your work was instrumental in helping me connect the mind-body in a theoretical way and then apply it to a yoga practice that I had been deeply committed to for years. It dropped in such an embodied way that suddenly for the first time it made sense, and I could do deeper transformational work and get clues and insights into my own psychology just by doing the same asana practice that I do every single day, but tuning in to my body in a different way and using the language of the chakras via your lens, it was very impactful to me. When I first discovered Wheels of Life and Eastern Body Western Mind, it provided me a very safe place and a specific tool to be able to gain the necessary insights to do some very serious healing work [which] allowed me the self confidence and allowed me to trust my intuition that created space for a lot of the service work I do in the world today. I couldn't have done it without the self-confidence and the tools from Eastern Body Western Mind allowed me to tap in! I want to thank you publicly for being such an influence and a brilliant mentor in my own person life."*

note from client: Could these testimonials  float up in a parallax fashion? I could even find pictures of these folks, though I don’t think it’s necessary.
