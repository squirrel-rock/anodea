                        <p>Anodea Judith Ph.D. has been called a "prophet for our time." A globally recognized teacher, speaker, healer, and writer on the intersection of personal and collective awakening, she is passionate about humanity's evolution in the face of our impending crises.</p>

                        <p>With a background in psychology and religious studies, Judith has dedicated her life to exploring the intricate connections between mind, body, and spirit. She is best known for her groundbreaking work on the chakra system, which she intricately weaves into her teachings, applying this profound system to Western psychology, yoga, the process of manifestation and cultural evolution.</p>

                        <p>Her <a href="books.html">best-selling books</a> have won several awards with well over a million books in print in 29 languages. She has taught in person across the US and Canada, as well as in 20 other countries and her online courses have reached over 160 different nations.</p>

                        <p>A riveting keynote inspirational speaker, her pictorial animated Power Points are like movies, with messages that bring hope without mincing words about the challenges of our times.</p>

                        <p>Now in her 70s, Anodea is beginning to turn her teaching over to her core faculty at the educational institution she founded, <a href="https://sacredcentersacademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sacred Centers Academy</a>, with training programs for individuals in teaching and practicing her work.</p>

                        <p>With renewed space for following her passion for cultural evolution, she works with the Evolutionary Leaders Council, the Holomovement, and the Founding Mothers Movement, as well as empowering feminine leadership through her own <a href="https://sherisesmovement.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">She Rises Movement</a>.</p>

                        <p>Her central vision is that humanity is going through an initiatory crisis to emerge into the next era of planetary maturity, a movement from an organizing principle based on the love of power to one based on the power of love. She feels humanity's ultimate purpose is to co-create with the Divine and learn how to create Heaven on Earth. These ideas were put forth in her double-award winning book: <em>The Global Heart Awakens</em>.</p>

                        <p>Anodea has also been involved in bringing in the cultural values of the feminine to create a more balanced partnership with the masculine. Ordained as a Priestess in 1985, she has created a set of guiding archetypes for women's leadership, and recently published a book on the Goddess.</p>

                        <p>Anodea Judith's dedication to personal and collective healing continues to resonate with people across the globe. Her teachings provide practical tools for individuals navigating life's challenges, making her an influential voice in contemporary spirituality and health. Through her books, workshops, and lectures, Judith remains a beacon of light for those on the path to self-discovery and transformation.</p>
