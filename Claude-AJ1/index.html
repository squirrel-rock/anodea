                        <h3>Goddess: Blessed Reunions with the Feminine Face of the Divine</h3>
                        <p>Anodea's latest work is poised to become a seminal book on the topic of the re-emergence of the feminine face of God, reaching far beyond the typical understanding of who the Goddess is and sparking a necessary conversation for today.</p>
                        <p>Anodea shares, "The Goddess is an essential archetype at the heart of all existence. She is not God in drag or Jehovah in a skirt."</p>
                        <p>This book is unique in Goddess literature because it speaks to us on a personal level as well. Utilizing the life cycles of the Mother, Maiden, Crone, and Queen and the mythic stories of the goddesses Demeter, Athena, Isis, Kali, and many others, Anodea demonstrates how people everywhere can directly rekindle their innate connection to the Divine Feminine and bring about the actualization of the Goddess within us all.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        "Anodea, you have had a huge influence on me personally as a student and the impact it has had on me as a teacher. Your work was instrumental in helping me connect the mind-body in a theoretical way and then apply it to a yoga practice that I had been deeply committed to for years. It dropped in such an embodied way that suddenly for the first time it made sense, and I could do deeper transformational work and get clues and insights into my own psychology just by doing the same asana practice that I do every single day, but tuning in to my body in a different way and using the language of the chakras via your lens, it was very impactful to me. When I first discovered Wheels of Life and Eastern Body Western Mind, it provided me a very safe place and a specific tool to be able to gain the necessary insights to do some very serious healing work [which] allowed me the self confidence and allowed me to trust my intuition that created space for a lot of the service work I do in the world today. I couldn't have done it without the self-confidence and the tools from Eastern Body Western Mind allowed me to tap in! I want to thank you publicly for being such an influence and a brilliant mentor in my own person life."
